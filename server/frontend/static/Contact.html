                Hello everyone, nice to meet you, my name is Jose Rosas. Welcome to my portfolio!!  My journey into the world of programming started quite simply; I've always really admired the world of technology and I've always been very curious about how applications and websites were developed, the tools behind them, the animations and everything else, I've always been fascinated by all of this.
                Every day, I tried to learn more about the areas in which I could work in programming. As I had mentioned previously, I do ADS, and it is one of the areas that I started to like a lot due to the diversity that exists within the area of ​​Systems Analysis and Development, however at the moment I am studying the area of ​​Web Development from the outside and every day I'm falling in love with the area.
                At the moment, in addition to studying at college, I am seeking knowledge on my own, taking free courses to complement and increase my knowledge in the area of ​​Technology and using free materials, participating in events and holding bootcamps to improve my skills.
